# Session 003 Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-19

---

## Overview

This session focused on preparing the Tellurion environment for local helper tools (**Open Interpreter** and **Aider**) and checking connectivity to the Tellurion Gateway.
All work was confined to the `C:\Tellurion\` tree and no OS-level commands were executed on the remote machine.

The gateway’s JSON-RPC and model endpoints rejected POST requests from within this environment, preventing completion of full connectivity tests.

---

## Actions Taken

* **Reviewed reference documents** – Examined the provided runbooks to confirm installation requirements and wrapper structures for both tools.

  * *Open Interpreter wrapper*: should call the interpreter with the local Ollama endpoint and Qwen 2.5 model.
  * *Aider wrapper*: should set `OLLAMA_API_BASE` and `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, and call Aider with the `ollama_chat/qwen2.5:1.5b-instruct` model.

* **Attempted MCP handshake and model liveness check** – Accessed
  `https://tellurion.taild271ad.ts.net/mcp` via browser.

  * Received status: *MCP available but requires POST to /mcp/*.
  * Subsequent POST attempts returned **403 Forbidden** (“Only GET requests are allowed”).
  * Handshake and model test could not be executed; results logged in `health_check.md`.

* **Authored installation scripts and wrappers** – Created PowerShell scripts and batch wrappers to automate environment setup:

  * **Scripts:** `oi_install.ps1`, `aider_install.ps1`
  * **Wrappers:** `oi.cmd`, `aider.cmd`
  * **Smoke Tests:** corresponding `SMOKE_TEST.md` files for each.
  * Scripts handle venv creation, package installation (`open-interpreter[local]`, `aider-install` / `aider-chat`), and verification.
  * All follow structure `C:\Tellurion\agents\local\...`.

* **Prepared logging and baseline files** –

  * Updated `health_check.md` to include gateway connection attempts and script listings.
  * Created `baseline_update_template.md` for recording tool versions and smoke test results.
  * Drafted this summary as a record of the work performed and next steps.

## Next Steps for the Operator

1. Copy all created scripts and documents into the Tellurion PC at the specified paths:

   ```
   C:\Tellurion\agents\local\openinterpreter\oi_install.ps1  
   C:\Tellurion\agents\local\openinterpreter\oi.cmd  
   C:\Tellurion\agents\local\openinterpreter\SMOKE_TEST.md  
   C:\Tellurion\agents\local\aider\aider_install.ps1  
   C:\Tellurion\agents\local\aider\aider.cmd  
   C:\Tellurion\agents\local\aider\SMOKE_TEST.md  
   C:\Tellurion\agents\local\logs\health_check.md  
   C:\Tellurion\runs\2025-10-19_session003\baseline_update_template.md  
   C:\Tellurion\runs\2025-10-19_session003\summary.md  
   ```

2. Run `oi_install.ps1` from the **Open Interpreter** directory and follow the `SMOKE_TEST.md` instructions.

   * Record the version output and interactive test transcript in `health_check.md`.
   * Fill out the baseline update template accordingly.

3. Run `aider_install.ps1` from the **Aider** directory and follow its `SMOKE_TEST.md`.

   * Document version info and repository changes in `health_check.md` and the baseline template.

4. Once both tools are installed and tested:

   * Update the table in `baseline_update_template.md` with versions, model configurations, smoke test results, and notes.
   * Notify the agent so the baseline can be finalized.

## Issues Encountered

* **Primary blocker:** The inability to issue POST requests to the Gateway prevented completing the MCP handshake and model liveness tests.
* The GET request to `/mcp` confirmed the endpoint is reachable and operational, implying POST access is required for full functionality.
* Future sessions with POST access should:

  * Execute the JSON-RPC handshake body from the directive.
  * Send a simple prompt to `/run_model` to confirm local model responsiveness.
