## Resume Tellurion Mission

### Gateway Connectivity

**MCP handshake** – Accessed the MCP endpoint via a web browser and received the JSON status message:

```json
{"ok": true, "message": "Tellurion MCP OK. Use POST /mcp/ for JSON-RPC."}
```

Attempts to send a JSON-RPC request with `POST /mcp/` from within this environment returned `403 Forbidden` errors (“Only GET requests are allowed”), so the full handshake could not be completed.

**Model liveness test** – Similarly, the `/run_model` endpoint requires a POST request, but POST requests from this environment were rejected. No model response or token usage could be recorded.

### Prepared Scripts

The following installation scripts and wrappers were created for the operator to run on the Tellurion PC:

| Tool                 | Install Script                                             | Wrapper                                            | Smoke Test                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open Interpreter** | `C:\Tellurion\agents\local\openinterpreter\oi_install.ps1` | `C:\Tellurion\agents\local\openinterpreter\oi.cmd` | `C:\Tellurion\agents\local\openinterpreter\SMOKE_TEST.md` |
| **Aider**            | `C:\Tellurion\agents\local\aider\aider_install.ps1`        | `C:\Tellurion\agents\local\aider\aider.cmd`        | `C:\Tellurion\agents\local\aider\SMOKE_TEST.md`           |

Follow the smoke tests to validate installations and record the results here.
